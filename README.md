Control your spotify player.

## Authorization

The adapter provides an extension for the authorization process.
Just open the menu and click on the `Spotify` entry.
After inserting your client id/secret, the adapter will redirect you to Spotify to grant the adapter access to your account.
Spotify will then redirect you back to the gateway.
